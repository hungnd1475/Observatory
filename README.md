# Observatory

Observatory is an experimental project attempting to create an email client using a C# cross-platform GUI framework called Uno Platform. This project aims to support basic features of an email client and run on the three major desktop platforms - Windows, MacOS and Linux. The reason behind Observatory is that while there are countless of email desktop clients out there, a majority of them are somewhat ugly and/or limited in some ways (For example, most feature-rich and good looking email clients are not free and/or open sourced, while most that are free and/or open sourced have an out dated design or not actively maintained any more). So as a software developer who loves to experiment with new things, I decided to make my own email client with a modern design that supports a basic set features. This project also serves as a learning process for me. This project is still very much a work in progress.

## Contributing

I am not accepting any contribution right now as I am not very familiar with managing an open source project. However, if you have any feedback, just open an issue for that and I will happily look at it.

## License

The project is currently unlicensed, but that may change in the future when I think it is mature and useful enough to be shared with the community.
